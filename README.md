# papers

This repo house some of my papers from my time at the University of Michigan after undergrad when working in the Department of Mathematics Education; during graduate school in the Lampe lab, studying collective intelligence, social networks, [social affordance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_affordance#:~:text=Social%20affordances%20%E2%80%93%20or%20more%20accurately,accessibility%20and%20society%20related%20changes.)) From my time in industry I've included some research work from my time at a health data startup, where I was involved with longitudinal analyses of patient outcomes of patients diagnosed with rare diseases and/or chronic conditions. 

## In reverse chronological order

### Department of Mathematics Education, School of Education
- Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS) – Creation of a unique iteration of the PALS-formatted scales, specifically designed for studying the learning environment, students' affect, motivation and behavior in post-secondary remedial and non-remedial mathematics students. I was a research assistant, focusing on data management and database creation and maintenance in the Department of Mathematics Education at the University of Michigan's School of Education.
